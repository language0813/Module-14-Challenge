# Module-14-Challenge

In this challenge, I successfully completed most of the requirements using the hints provided in the starter file. However, I still encountered a few issues, which are listed in the following sections:

## Build metadata panel

- In the step of using `.html("")` to clear exisiting information that was loaded previously, I asked ChatGPT about its function so I could apply it in the correct place, even though the syntax was provided in the starter file.

- In order to match the example dashboard in the instruction, I consulted ChatGPT about how to convert lowercase strings to uppercase and learned the new method `.map(str => str.toUpperCase())`.

## Build bar chart and bubble chart

- I had trouble getting the `otu_ids`, `otu_labels`, and `sample_values`. However, I was able to fix my code and resolve the issues by using `console.log()` to inspect the outputs in the console.

- I created the bar chart without any issue, but I wasn't sure how to create a bubble chart at first. Eventually, I got help from ChatGPT and was able to build the bubble chart.

## Create function for initial page

- I successfully created the function to load the initial page. This was easier because the previous steps of this homework made me more familiar with JavaScript.
